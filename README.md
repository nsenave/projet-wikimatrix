# Wikipedia Matrix

Extracting Wikipedia tables into CSV files (basic skeleton for testing/benchmarking solutions). Once the git is cloned:
```
cd wikimatrix 
mvn test
``` 

We give 300+ Wikipedia URLs and the challenge is to:
 * integrate the extractors' code (HTML and Wikitext)
 * extract as many relevant tables as possible 
 * serialize the results into CSV files (within `output/html` and `output/wikitext`) 
 
More details can be found in `BenchTest.java`. We are expecting to launch `mvn test` and the results will be in `output` folder 

## Notes

Java Jvm 1.8 minimum is required
